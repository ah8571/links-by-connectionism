# Links by cnxt

**The free, open-source link-in-bio platform.**

Linktree charges $5–24/month. Stan Store charges $29/month. Both are serving a styled page with a list of links. Links by cnxt does the same thing — for free — and you own everything.

---

## Why

Every creator needs a link-in-bio page. Most are paying monthly fees for what is fundamentally a small file served through a CDN. There's no reason this should cost money.

Links by cnxt strips the problem down to its core: **each creator's profile is a JSON file, rendered as a fast static page, served at the edge.** No bloated backend. No database. No vendor lock-in.

## How It Works

```
yourapp.com/username → fetch JSON → render page → done
```

1. A creator signs up and edits their profile through a simple dashboard.
2. Their profile is saved as a JSON file in cloud storage (Cloudflare R2).
3. When someone visits their page, a lightweight edge function fetches the JSON and renders it instantly.
4. Click analytics are tracked with simple counters — no cookies, no third-party tracking.

That's the entire architecture.

## Architecture

Built entirely on Cloudflare's infrastructure:

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Storage | Cloudflare R2 (one JSON file per creator) |
| Backend | Cloudflare Workers (tiny API) |
| Frontend | Cloudflare Pages (creator dashboard) |
| CDN | Cloudflare (built-in, global) |
| Analytics | Cloudflare KV (lightweight counters) |
| Auth | Passwordless magic links |

The entire platform runs within Cloudflare's free tier for thousands of users.

## Pricing

**Free for creators.** A link-in-bio page costs essentially nothing to serve. We're not going to charge for it.

For high-traffic creators with heavy usage, there may be a minimal hosting fee to cover real infrastructure costs — but we're talking dollars, not $29/month.

We're also building toward a **self-host option**: deploy to your own Cloudflare account, pay nothing, and own your entire stack.
